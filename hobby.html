    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>When I'm not developing the web, I like to unwind with a few hobbies that keep me balanced and entertained. <br>
        I spend a lot of time sketching futuristic cityscapes, blending architecture and sci-fi elements as a fun way to <br>
        stretch my creativity beyond code. I also enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, often trying to recreate dishes <br>
        from different cultures — with varying levels of success, but always with enthusiasm. And when I really need to <br>
        reset, I compete in online rubber duck beauty contests — a deeply unserious but fiercely competitive corner of the <br>
        internet where presentation is everything.</p>
